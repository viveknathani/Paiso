# Paiso
Paiso is an expense tracking app. I made it because I wanted to step into android development and I wanted to make something useful for myself.

### Development and Progress
I am using [MP Android Chart](https://github.com/PhilJay/MPAndroidChart) for providing statistics in this app.
I have sent out this app to three people for their daily use. They give me feedback upon which I work.
